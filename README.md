This is a quick sample collection of my review the interesting history of UIScrollView since 2009 (the one important history I missed).

UIScrollView Session History by Josh Shaffer and Eliza Block.

* 2009 - **Mastering iPhone Scroll Views**: basics
* 2010 - **Desiging Apps with Scroll Views**: photo browsing, tiling
* 2011 - **Advanced Scroll View Techniques**: infinite scrolling, stationary views, interaction with gestures.
* 2012 - **Enhanced User Experience with Scroll Views**: photo browsing 2.0, scrolling with OpenGL, custom deceleration
* 2013 - **Exploring Scroll Views in iOS 7**: nested scroll views, integration with dynamics

For 2009 session, I cannot find original sample code, therefore I rewrite it based on what I saw from the session video. My major interest is the philosophy of UIKit design.
